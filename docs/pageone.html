            <li>Register  <a href=mailto:bodshelpdesk@kpmg.co.uk> here</a> if you do not have an account. </li>
            <li>Reset your password <a href=https://publish.bus-data.dft.gov.uk/account/password/reset/> here</a> if you have forgotten it. </li>
            <li>Log in <a href=https://publish.bus-data.dft.gov.uk/account/login/> here</a> if you already have an account. </li>

        <p class=""></p><br/>Now you have an account, you will need to obtain your data. <br/><br/><p>

            <li> Download the free <a href=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1069779/PTI-compliant-TxC-tool.xlsm> TransXchange tool here.</a> You can find more information <a href=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/transxchange> here.</a> </li>
            <li> Use the free <a href=https://fares-data.dft.gov.uk/> Create Fares Data Service </a> to create your fares information </li>
            <li> If you do not have a tracking device, you can find a <a href=SUPPLIER> supplier here.</a> If you are unsure as to whether you already have a tracking device contact your supplier. </li>

    <p class=""></p><br/>Now you have your datasets, you will need to log into your <a href=https://publish.bus-data.dft.gov.uk/account/login/> account. </a> Once you have logged in, there will be a clear step to step direction to help you upload your datasets in your portal. <p></p> <br>

            <li> Agents - if you used an agent then you will need to go into your account and add them into your portal. How much an agent helps you is dependent on the agreement between the operator and the agent. Not all agents offer the same services so please check with them if you are unsure.</li>
            <li> Suppliers - if you do not wish to use the free tools, there are other services that are available to you which you can find <a href=SUPPLIER> here. </a>  </li>
